NAME

    MakeAnsibleHosts - Generate ansible hosts file

SYNOPSIS

    # in your ~/environments/deployment.yml file

    extra_worker_plugins: - X::MakeAnsibleHosts

    plugin_ansible: root_dir: '/opt/ansible' down_age: '7 days' excluded: [
    'group:ansible_exclude' ] by_hostname: [ 'group:__ANY__' ] groups:
    'group1': - 'group:netdisco_group' osmap: 'os_ansible': -
    'os:netdisco_os'

Description

    This is a plugin for the App::Netdisco network management application.
    It adds a worker to export the Devices seen by Netdisco to an ansible
    hosts inventory to use it with ansible playbooks.

    In the hosts file, the devices are sorted in two groups: - group by OS
    - group by name selector

Configuration

    Create an entry in your ~/environments/deployment.yml file named
    "plugin_ansible", containing the following settings:

 root_dir

    Value: String. Default: "$ENV{NETDISCO_HOME}/ansible"

    Location where will be created the hosts file. The default value is
    ansible directory in the under the NETDISCO_HOME dir

 down_age

    This should be the same or greater than the interval between regular
    discover jobs on your network. Devices which have not been discovered
    within this time will be excluded from export to ansible host

    The format is any time interval known and understood by PostgreSQL,
    such as at
    https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/functions-datetime.html.

 groups

    This dictionary maps ansible group names with configuration which will
    match devices in the Netdisco database.

    The left hand side (key) should be the ansible group name, the right
    hand side (value) should be a Netdisco ACL
    <https://github.com/netdisco/netdisco/wiki/Configuration#access-control-lists>
    to select devices in the Netdisco database.

 excluded

    Netdisco ACL
    <https://github.com/netdisco/netdisco/wiki/Configuration#access-control-lists>
    to identify devices that will be excluded from the Ansible hosts

 by_ip

    Netdisco ACL
    <https://github.com/netdisco/netdisco/wiki/Configuration#access-control-lists>
    to select devices that will be written to the host file as an IP
    address instead of DNS FQDN or SNMP hostname.

 by_hostname

    Netdisco ACL
    <https://github.com/netdisco/netdisco/wiki/Configuration#access-control-lists>
    to select devices which will have the unqualified hostname written to
    the ansible_host
    <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/special_variables.html#term-ansible_host>
    host_var file instead of the IP address.

 osmap

    If the device vendor in Netdisco is not the same as the os defined in
    Ansible. Mainly used to map devices with the correct module to ansible.

    The left hand side (key) should be the ansible group, the right hand
    side (value) should be a Netdisco ACL
    <https://github.com/netdisco/netdisco/wiki/Configuration#access-control-lists>
    to select devices in the Netdisco database.
